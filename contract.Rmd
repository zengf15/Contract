1) Earn “Satisfactory” on 11 self-paced lab assignments on the schedule specified below.
	-  Satisfactory defined:

  	-  I have checked that forked files, repos, or projects appear on my Github account and are accessible;
  	-  I feel like I have spent an adequate amount of time and energy on assignments; 
<!-- (tentatively defining “adequate” based on Lab 1 and previous experience with R: I will spend at least 30 minutes on labs and at least 1 hour on portfolio pieces); -->
  	-  My unessays are organized, thoughtful, and free of grammar mistakes or typos;
  	-  My presentation is professional and engaging.
2) Produce at least 10 “Satisfactory” portfolio pieces on the schedule specified below.
